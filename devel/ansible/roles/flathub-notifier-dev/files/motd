Welcome to Flathub Notifier development environment!

* The code for the-new-hotness is located at ~/devel/

* Run `devstart` to start the notifier services and `devstop` to stop it.

* Logs for the server are available with `journalctl` or `devlog`; the service is run
  as systemd user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/

* Run tests with `tox`
Happy hacking!
